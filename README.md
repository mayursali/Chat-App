<h3>How to Install and Run the Project</h3>
<p><b>Clone the Repository:</b> Start by cloning the project repository from GitHub to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and use the following command:</p>
<p><b>Set Up Dependencies:</b> Check if the project has any specific dependencies or requirements. Look for a requirements.txt file in the project's root directory, which lists the required packages and their versions. Install these dependencies by running the following command:</p>
<p><b>Configuration:</b> Some projects require additional configuration settings. Look for configuration files (e.g., .env or .config) and follow the instructions provided in the project's documentation or README file. This may include setting up database connections, API keys, or environment variables.</p>
<p><b>Database Setup:</b>  If the project uses a database, you'll need to set it up. Look for database configuration files or migration scripts. Run the necessary commands (e.g., python manage.py migrate) to create the required tables and schema in the database.</p>
<p><b>Static Files and Assets:</b> If the project includes static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript, images), you may need to collect and compile them. Use the appropriate commands provided by the project (e.g., python manage.py collectstatic) to gather the static files in a designated directory.</p>
<p><b>Run the Application:</b> Once the dependencies and configurations are in place, you can start the application. Use the appropriate command provided by the project (e.g., python manage.py runserver) to run the development server. This command will start the application, and you can access it by visiting the provided URL in your browser.</p>
